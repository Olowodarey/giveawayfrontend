#### "What are gift cards?"
Gift cards are like prepaid cards for specific stores. You can use them to buy products or services just like cash, but only at that particular store.

#### "Why convert crypto to gift cards?"
If you don't want to deal with cryptocurrency, gift cards let you use your payment immediately at familiar stores like Amazon, without learning anything about crypto.

#### "Is it safe?"
Yes! The conversion happens instantly and you receive a standard gift card code that works exactly like gift cards you'd buy in stores.

#### "Can I convert back to crypto?"
