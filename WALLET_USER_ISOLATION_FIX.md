# Wallet User Isolation Fix

## Problem
When logging in with different email accounts, all users were seeing the same wallet address. This was a critical security issue where wallets were not properly isolated per user.

## Root Cause
The wallet data was being stored in `localStorage` without tracking which user it belonged to. When a different user logged in, the old wallet from localStorage was loaded instead of creating/fetching the correct wallet for the new user.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User ID Tracking
Now we store the user ID alongside the wallet data in localStorage:
- `chipi_wallet` - The wallet data
- `wallet_user_id` - The user ID (email or Clerk user ID)
- `wallet_pin` - The auto-generated PIN

### 2. User Verification on Load
When the app loads, we verify that the saved wallet belongs to the current user:

```typescript
const savedWallet = localStorage.getItem("chipi_wallet")
const savedUserId = localStorage.getItem("wallet_user_id")
const currentUserId = user?.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress || user?.id

if (savedWallet && savedUserId === currentUserId) {
  // Same user - load their wallet
  setWallet(JSON.parse(savedWallet))
} else if (savedWallet && savedUserId !== currentUserId) {
  // Different user - clear old wallet and create new one
  localStorage.clear()
  setWallet(null)
  setAutoConnectAttempted(false)
}
```

### 3. Automatic Wallet Switching
When a different user logs in:
1. Old wallet data is cleared from localStorage
2. New wallet is automatically created/fetched for the new user
3. Each user gets their own unique wallet address

## Changes Made

### File: `contexts/wallet-context.tsx`

#### Added User Verification:
- Check if saved wallet belongs to current user
- Clear old wallet if user has changed
- Reset auto-connect flag for new users

#### Updated Wallet Storage:
- Store user ID with wallet data
- Verify user ID on every load
- Clear user ID on disconnect

#### Enhanced Logging:
- Log which user is being loaded
- Log when different user is detected
- Log wallet creation for debugging

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Login with User A
1. Sign in with user-a@gmail.com
2. Wallet is created automatically
3. Note the wallet address (e.g., 0xAAA...AAA)

### Test Case 2: Switch to User B
1. Sign out
2. Sign in with user-b@gmail.com
3. **Expected:** New wallet is created with different address (e.g., 0xBBB...BBB)
4. **Verify:** Address is different from User A

### Test Case 3: Return to User A
1. Sign out
2. Sign in with user-a@gmail.com again
3. **Expected:** Same wallet address as before (0xAAA...AAA)
4. **Verify:** Wallet was retrieved, not re-created

### Test Case 4: Multiple Tabs
1. Sign in with User A in Tab 1
2. Open Tab 2 (same browser)
3. Sign in with User B in Tab 2
4. **Expected:** Each tab shows correct wallet for its user

## Console Logs to Verify

### When Same User Logs In:
```
Loaded wallet for user: user-a@gmail.com
```

### When Different User Logs In:
```
Different user detected, clearing old wallet
Old user: user-a@gmail.com New user: user-b@gmail.com
Auto-connecting wallet for user: user-b@gmail.com
Creating new wallet automatically...
Wallet created successfully
Wallet auto-connected successfully!
```

## Security Benefits

1. ✅ **Wallet Isolation** - Each user has their own wallet
2. ✅ **No Cross-User Access** - Users can't access other users' wallets
3. ✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Old wallet data is cleared on user switch
4. ✅ **Persistent Per User** - Each user's wallet persists for them
5. ✅ **Deterministic PINs** - Same user always gets same PIN

## What Users Experience

### User A's Journey:
1. Sign in → Wallet 0xAAA...AAA created
2. Claim prizes → Works with their wallet
3. Sign out
4. Sign in again → Same wallet 0xAAA...AAA retrieved

### User B's Journey:
1. Sign in → Wallet 0xBBB...BBB created (different from User A)
2. Claim prizes → Works with their wallet
3. Sign out
4. Sign in again → Same wallet 0xBBB...BBB retrieved

### No Interference:
- User A's wallet is never shown to User B
- User B's wallet is never shown to User A
- Each user has complete isolation

## Additional Improvements

### localStorage Keys Used:
- `chipi_wallet` - Wallet data (address, keys)
- `wallet_user_id` - User identifier (email or Clerk ID)
- `wallet_pin` - Auto-generated PIN for wallet encryption
- `wallet_toast_shown` - Flag to show "Wallet Ready" toast once

### Cleanup on Disconnect:
All localStorage keys are cleared when user signs out:
```typescript
const disconnectWallet = () => {
  setWallet(null)
  localStorage.removeItem("chipi_wallet")
  localStorage.removeItem("wallet_pin")
  localStorage.removeItem("wallet_user_id")
  localStorage.removeItem("wallet_toast_shown")
  setError(null)
}
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Different users get different wallet addresses
- [x] Same user gets same wallet on return
- [x] Old wallet is cleared when user switches
- [x] User ID is stored with wallet data
- [x] User ID is verified on load
- [x] Auto-connect resets for new users
- [x] Console logs show correct user switching
- [x] No cross-user wallet access possible

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Each user now has their own isolated wallet that persists correctly across sessions.
