- ❌ `Test`

### 📧 Communication

### 🔒 Security

- Use secure communication channels

## Troubleshooting

### "Worker can't find their code"
- Resend the email/message
- Check spam folder
- Verify code wasn't already claimed

### "Worker says code is invalid"
- Check payment name spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify code wasn't already used
- Confirm payment batch was created successfully

### "Worker doesn't have crypto wallet"
- No problem! Wallet auto-created on claim
- They just need a Gmail account
- Guide them through sign-up process

### "Need to add more team members"
- Create a new payment batch
- Or add to existing batch (if not finalized)
