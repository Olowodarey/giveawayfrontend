# Bulk Salary Payments Feature

## Overview

StarkGive now supports **bulk salary payments** - a revolutionary way for project owners to pay their team members without the hassle of collecting wallet addresses. Workers can claim their salaries using simple claim codes, with zero gas fees and automatic wallet creation.

## The Problem We Solve

### Traditional Crypto Payroll Challenges:
1. **Wallet Address Collection**: Tedious process of collecting and verifying wallet addresses from team members
2. **Gas Fees**: Workers need to have funds for gas fees to receive payments
3. **Crypto Barriers**: Team members without crypto wallets can't receive payment
4. **Spreadsheet Management**: Complex tracking of who got paid what amount
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Wallet addresses reveal payment history and balances

## The StarkGive Solution

### How It Works:

#### For Project Owners / Employers:
1. **Create Payment Batch**: Name your payment (e.g., "March 2024 Salaries")
2. **Add Team Members**: List workers by name with their respective amounts
   - Example: Alice (500 STRK), Bob (750 STRK), Carol (600 STRK)
3. **Generate Claim Codes**: System creates unique codes for each person
4. **Distribute Codes**: Share codes via email, Slack, Discord, or any messaging platform
5. **Track Claims**: Monitor who has claimed their payment

#### For Workers / Team Members:
1. **Receive Code**: Get your unique claim code from your employer
2. **Visit Claim Page**: Go to StarkGive and enter the payment name + your code
3. **Sign Up**: Create account with Gmail (if you don't have one)
4. **Auto Wallet**: Wallet is automatically created and linked to your email
5. **Claim Gasless**: Receive your salary with ZERO gas fees
6. **Done**: STRK tokens are in your wallet, ready to use
