## Changes Made

### 1. Homepage Hero Section (`app/page.tsx`)
**Updated messaging to highlight both use cases:**
- **Old**: "Run Mystery Giveaways Your Followers Will Love"
- **New**: "Pay Salaries & Run Giveaways Without the Hassle"

**New value proposition:**
- "Bulk salary payments with claim codes. No wallet addresses needed."
- "Workers claim gasless. Perfect for giveaways and payroll."

**Updated CTAs:**
- Primary: "Pay Team / Create Giveaway"
- Secondary: "Claim Payment"

### 2. Features Section
**Expanded from 3 to 4 feature cards:**

#### New Features Highlighted:
1. **No Wallet Hassle** (UserCheck icon)
   - Pay workers by name with claim codes
   - No wallet address collection needed

2. **Zero Gas Fees** (Zap icon)
   - Workers claim salary with zero fees
   - No crypto knowledge required

3. **Bulk Payments** (Wallet icon)
   - Pay entire teams at once
   - Generate unique codes for each member

4. **Fully On-Chain** (Shield icon)

### 3. New "Use Cases" Section
**Added comprehensive dual-purpose showcase:**

#### Team Salary Payments Card:
- **The Problem**: Collecting wallet addresses is tedious, gas fees eat into salaries
- **The Solution**: Create payment batch with member names, generate codes, workers claim gasless
- **Example Workflow**: 
  - Create payment: "March Salaries"
  - Add: Alice (500 STRK), Bob (750 STRK), Carol (600 STRK)
  - Generate codes and send to team
  - Team claims instantly, zero fees

#### Community Giveaways Card:
- **The Problem**: Complex setups, gas fees for winners, public prize amounts
- **The Solution**: Mystery giveaways with hidden amounts, gasless claims, social sharing
- **Example Workflow**:
  - Create giveaway: "1000 Followers Celebration"
  - Set 10 winners with random amounts (10-100 STRK)
  - Post codes on Twitter/Discord
  - Winners claim and share excitement

### 4. Updated "How It Works" Section
**Rebranded for dual audience:**

#### For Project Owners (formerly "For Creators"):
1. Sign Up with Gmail
2. Deposit STRK Tokens (for salary payments or giveaway pool)
3. Create Payment Batch (team members by name or equal/random splits)
4. Generate & Share Codes (via email, chat, or social media)

#### For Workers / Recipients (formerly "For Winners"):
1. Receive Your Code (from employer or social media)
2. Sign Up & Enter Code (with payment name)
3. Auto Wallet Created (no crypto knowledge needed)
4. Claim Your Payment (salary or prize, zero gas fees)

### 5. Updated CTA Section
**New dual-purpose call-to-action:**
- **Headline**: "Ready to Simplify Your Payments?"
- **Subheading**: "Join project owners paying teams gasless and creators building engaged communities"
- **Two CTAs**:
  - Primary: "Pay Your Team"
  - Secondary: "Create Giveaway"
